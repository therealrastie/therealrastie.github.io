    <p>Data Scientist with insatiable intellectual curiosity, and ability to mine hidden gems located within large sets of structured, semi-structured and raw data. My background in sales gave me a foundation in data analysis and the ability to communicate my results in an effective and intuitive way. My transition came with the interest in drawing valid conclusions from large amount of sales data that can immediately and positively impact financial results.
            I attended George Washington University bootcamp earning certifications in Data Analytics and Visualization. While at GWU, I advanced my skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. </p>

            <p>My love for numbers and structured thinking approach coupled with my passion for solving problems and programming experience makes me a great data scientist.</p>
